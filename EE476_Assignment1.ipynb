        "# EE 467 Homework 1: Twitter Spam Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first homework of EE 467! Here we will apply the ML pipline introduced in the second lab to **Twitter spam message detection problems**. In the past few years, social medias like Twitter has become the target of spam posting. Automatic spam posts can not only affect user experience, but they can also spread misinformation and subtly affect public opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework, we will work on a mini Twitter message dataset extracted from the CRESCI-2017 dataset. This dataset contains 50000 Twitter messages, half of which are sent by real Twitter users and half of which generated by spam bots. Your task is to train classifiers that can tell these two kinds of messages apart. This time, you'll go deeper and try multiple feature extractors and classifiers. Like the labs, you will need to fill out blanks in code cells. You are also going to answer a few questions and **optionally** work on improvements to existing pipeline completely on your own.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Before You Start\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You can discuss on Slack if you have questions and want to seek help; however, please try your best to **limit the scope of your question** and **avoid asking directly for answers**. You should also **avoid copy-pasting answers and code** from others.\n",
        "2. You **may use AI assistants** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to support your work. If you do, you must **clearly acknowledge** this by stating:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The name of the AI assistant**, and  \n",
        "- **How it was used** (e.g., brainstorming, clarifying concepts, debugging, editing, generating examples)\n",
        "\n",
        "You **must not copy and paste** AI-generated content directly into your submission without **fully understanding** what it does and being able to **explain it in your own words**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. You can **optionally work on this homework with one other student of this course as a team**, but **each of you needs to submit the homework individually**. If you choose to form a group, please include the name of your teammate here: _(Name of your teammate)_.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "We will begin our ML pipeline with feature extraction in this homework, as the dataset is good enough and does not need any special pre-processing. As usual, we will load the dataset into memory, extract samples features into vectors and split the dataset into training and test sets."

On the other hand, unique yet frequent (in any $d \\in D_t$) words will get higher weight. Research has shown that TF-IDF is easy to implement and performs relatively well.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** In `classification_report`, **support** is the number of true (actual) samples for each class in the dataset being evaluated. For example, in our test set with 10,000 samples, if there are 5,000 ham (label 0) and 5,000 spam (label 1), the support for each class would be 5000. Support indicates how many ground-truth examples of each class were used to compute the precision, recall, and F1-score for that class."

Compare `accuracy` with `f1-score`. Based on your criterion, which type of classifier is better? Please give some justifications to support your answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** When the training data is highly unbalanced, **accuracy is generally not a good metric**. For example, if 99% of samples are negative, a classifier that always predicts negative would achieve 99% accuracy but would miss all positive samples, with F1 = 0 for the positive class. **High accuracy does not imply high F1-score**; accuracy can be inflated by correctly predicting the majority class while failing on the minority class.\n",

        "3. **Collect more data:** Acquire additional minority-class samples to improve representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluation metrics:** Use metrics suited to imbalanced data (e.g., F1-score, precision-recall curve, AUC-PR) instead of accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Threshold adjustment:** Lower the decision threshold for the positive class to increase recall at the cost of precision, or tune the threshold using validation data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Ensemble methods:** Use techniques like EasyEnsemble or BalancedBaggingClassifier that combine multiple undersampled subsets with the minority class."
